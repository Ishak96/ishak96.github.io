I am a research scientist at CY Cergy Paris University, part of the [ETIS Laboratory](https://www.etis-lab.fr/) in Cergy, France. My work combines signal processing and machine learning, focusing on imaging inverse problems and computational imaging.  

I obtained my Ph.D. in November 2024 from CY Cergy Paris University. During my Ph.D., I proposed innovative methods like UnWave-Net for advanced image reconstruction. My efforts were recognized with the **Best Young Scientist Award at MICCAI 2024**.

With a passion for advancing AI-driven imaging solutions, I am excited to explore new challenges and contribute to transformative innovations.
